# Acknowledgments

It's easy to underestimate how hard it is to write a book. My wife says her
superpower is forgetting how bad things can get; maybe she's been rubbing off on
me, because only a very crazy or very forgetful man would decide to write a
third book. And that's not to mention all the books that were started and died
in the water before this one took hold.

This particular piece of prose has been a wonderful whirlwind. The seed came to
me while hanging out with some friends who wanted to combine quantum mechanics
with game theory. I offered to sit down with them to help formalize their ideas
in Agda. I had no idea what I was doing, but it quickly became clear that my
ability to weave proofs in Agda more than made up for my abject failure to
understand what they were going on about.

That night I jotted down some quick notes about what such a book could look
like. Little did I know, those scribbles would come to dominate the next year of
my life. A lot has changed in that year---I've gotten married, gone back to
school, and have done a lot of growing up. Through all of it, I've been working
on this book, and it's frankly a little bittersweet to be finished this thing
that's been with me for so long.

Many people were involved in helping tie the knot in reality from which this
book springs forth.
