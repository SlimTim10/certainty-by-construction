# Acknowledgments

It's easy to underestimate how hard it is to write a book. My wife says her
superpower is forgetting how bad things can get; maybe she's been rubbing off on
me, because only a very crazy or very forgetful man would decide to write a
third book. And that's not to mention all the books that were started and died
in the water before this one took hold.

This particular piece of prose has been a wonderful whirlwind. The seed came to
me while hanging out with some friends who wanted to combine quantum mechanics
with game theory. I offered to sit down with them to help formalize their ideas
in Agda. I had no idea what I was doing, but it quickly became clear that my
ability to weave proofs in Agda more than made up for my abject failure to
understand what they were going on about.

That night I jotted down some quick notes about what such a book could look
like. Little did I know, those scribbles would come to dominate the next year of
my life. A lot has changed in that year---I've gotten married, gone back to
school, and have done a lot of growing up. Through all of it, I've been working
on this book, and it's frankly a little bittersweet to be finished this thing
that's been with me for so long.

Many people were involved in helping tie the knot in reality from which this
book springs forth. Some of the particularly instrumental people in this journey
are:

*Erin Jackes,* for being my muse, my guiding star, and my one true love. Without
her support and outstanding company, I never would have found the wherewithal to
make it to the finish line.

*Reed Mullanix,* who has never once balked at taking an hour out of his day to
explain something to me. And I ask *very often.* Most of the technical things I
know have been taught to me by Reed.

*Conal Elliott,* for his unwavering dedication to beauty and simplicity, and for
inspiring me to demand more from my work. I pray that one day my taste will be
half as good as his.

Other fantastic people whom I can't praise enough include Solomon Bothwell, Shae
Erisson, Li-yao Xia, Jonathan Lorimer, Asad Saeeduddin, Callan McGill, and the
whole Cofree Coffee crew. Andrew McKnight, Kenneth Bruskiewicz, and Yanze Li
were instrumental in helping me get through some nasty proofs. Farhad Mehta,
John Hughes, Judah Jacobson, Ryan Hunter, thank you all for your support. A huge
thank you to Tim Johns for such keen proof-reading.

The punchy cover was designed by Laura Stepšytė. The interior styling was
inspired by the work of Bob Nystrom, and the color scheme is lifted from Byrne's
Euclid. The book is compiled through an unholy matrimony made possible by John
MacFarlane, Rijnard van Tonder and Amélia Liao, among others. Some ideas for
what a book on Agda should be like came from *Programming Language Foundations
in Agda,* although I must admit (abashedly) that I haven't actually read it.
Yet. This book uses Dan Zadorozny's excellent font "Special Agent Condensed,"
and the spectacular "Front Page Neue" by Allison James.

Finally, my most sincere gratitude goes out to everyone who has helped make Agda
happen. It's a marvelous piece of technology with a delightful community, and is
the most fun I've had programming in years.

Thank you all most sincerely, from the very bottom of my heart.

# About the Author

Sandy Maguire is a man of many facets, whose passion for software correctness
has led him to become the author of three influential books in the field. He
firmly believes that a combination of solid theoretical foundations and the
practical wisdom to apply them is paramount in the world of software
development.

In addition to theoretical software, Sandy's interests are as diverse as they
are unique. He's an avid car-hater who finds solace from the busy city as a
talented pianist. His enthusiasm doesn't stop there, as he's also a dedicated
parkour enthusiast, constantly seeking new heights and challenges.

Not content with the status quo, Sandy stepped away from the software industry
in 2018 to actively pursue change. He's a self-described author, programmer,
musician, and trouble-maker who's been immersed in the world of coding for over
two decades. With considerable time and experience, he feels like he's finally
making progress on where good software comes from.

Currently residing in Vancouver with his wife Erin, you can find Sandy
vigorously researching programming languages and delving into the intricacies of
mathematics. When he's not busy advocating for purely functional programming, he
can be found leaping over obstacles and attempting not to destroy coffee
machines. Sandy Maguire's unique blend of expertise, creativity, and adventurous
spirit make him a compelling and dynamic figure in the world of software.
