# Under Construction

This book, "Certainty by Construction" is itself under construction. The copy
you have in your hands right now is a rough draft, intended to beta test the
material and solicit feedback.

In general, I'd say the book is about 80% done. This is more or less all the
material I want to cover, though the second half of the book will probably be
twice as long once I'm through editing it all. Thus, I'm not yet looking for
feedback regarding typography or typos, but more about its overall structure and
bits that don't make sense.

If you ever find yourself wondering what the hell is going on, please do let me
know exactly when you noticed that feeling, and what particular answers would
help get you unstuck.

Please file any constructive feedback as issues at the following URL:

`github.com/isovector/certainty-by-construction/issues`

Thanks for reading! I hope you like it!

Best,
Sandy
