# Under Construction

This book, "Certainty by Construction" is itself under construction. The copy
you have in your hands right now is a rough draft, intended to beta test the
material and solicit feedback.

In general, I'd say the book is about 90% done. This is more or less all the
material I want to cover, but there are several sections that could use some
more explanatory power.

If you ever find yourself wondering what the hell is going on, please do let me
know exactly when you noticed that feeling, and what particular answers would
help get you unstuck. Also, I'm very interested in typos, random thoughts, or
what-have-yous.

Please file any constructive feedback as issues at the following URL:

`github.com/isovector/certainty-by-construction/issues`

Thanks for reading! I hope you like it!

Best,

Sandy
